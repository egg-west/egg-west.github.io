**Queen Mary University of London** : *Sep.2020*~*To present*

I work on state abstraction for strategy game playing. My current focus is developing general state abstraction methods that empowers complex game playing to better efficience and performance.

Neural networks are abstracting the observation automatically, but explicit abstraction finds additional beneftis that leads to new theoretical results and new STOA performance for generalization and exploration.
