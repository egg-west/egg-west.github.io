I will soon Join [Game AI Group](http://gameai.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at Queen Mary University of London as a PhD student working with Prof. Diego Perez.

Working on Reinforcement Learning and Multi-task Learning.



# Education
<img src="./assets/img/ncu_logo.png" alt="uni_logo" width="120" height="120" align="left" /> **Nanchang University** : *Sep.2016*~*Jun.2020*

B.E Software Engineering.  GPA: **3.0/4.0** (with a **3.6** in my first semester and after that I spent a long time figured out **where I am and where I wanna reach** in computer science world. Obviously, I used a unimodal Gaussian Policy so almost no action is took for examination. **Reinforcement Learning joke: the value function of my GPA is overestimated!** )
